In this post I will show you how to audit changes in entity framework 6. This is a very common requirement in enterprise applications.
The auditing can serve a variety of purposes such as:
- Security
- Compliance
- Debugging

In the enterprise application world it is very important to know who changed what and when. This is where auditing comes in.

Now before digging into the implementation details lets think about the design for a moment. In a typical enterprise application you will likely have a lot of entities that you will want to audit. Also there will be many endpoints that end up mutating the state of these entities and persisting the changes. This means that you will have to write a lot of boilerplate and lot of repetitive code to audit changes for each entity. You can see this quicly becomming very cumbersome and tedious for maintenance. We want to write the code once and reuse it for all entities. Ideally we do not want to have to change the implementation each time a new entity or a new endpoint is added.

This leads us in the direction of thinking about a generic solution. One that will rely on some kind of interception mechanism or a middleware that will be able to capture the changes and persist them to the database each time an entity state is mutated. Furtnermore the implemenation of the audit log should not be dealing with any particular instance of an entity, rather it should be able to deal with an interface that auditable entities implement.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
